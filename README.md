## üß† Code Description
A network device simulation system where users can create, configure, and interact with various network components. Designed using object-oriented programming principles, the system provides a hands-on, command-line experience of managing a basic digital network.

The users can choose between a **Router**, **Modem**, or **Hub** each with its own specialized behaviors:

üñß The **Router** simulates a wireless gateway, allowing users to log in, configure WiFi settings (SSID and password), and manage local network traffic.  
```python
class Router(NetworkDevice):
    def authenticate(self):
        for attempt in range(3):
            print("\nEnter the router's login credentials:")
            username = input("Username: ").strip()
            password = input("Password: ").strip()
            if username and password:
                print("\nLogin successful.")
                return True
            else:
                print("\nInvalid credentials. Please try again.")
        print("\nAuthentication failed after 3 attempts.")
        return False

    def configure(self):
        while True:
            response = input("\nWould you like to configure your WiFi network? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
            if response == "yes":
                ssid = input("Enter WiFi network name (SSID): ").strip()
                wifi_password = input("Enter WiFi password: ").strip()
                if ssid and wifi_password:
                    print(f"\nWiFi network '{ssid}' has been successfully configured.")
                    return
                else:
                    print("\nInvalid input. Both SSID and password must be provided.")
            elif response == "no":
                print("\nSkipping WiFi configuration.")
                return
            else:
                print("\nInvalid choice. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")

    def operate(self):
        if self.is_status:
            print("\nTo operate the router, connect it to a modem and Ethernet.")
            if self.authenticate():
                self.configure()
                print(f"\nRouter at {self.ip_address} is now managing network traffic.")
        else:
            print("\nRouter is offline. Connect it first.")
```
üåê The **Modem** acts as a communication bridge between the local network and the ISP. It requires user authentication and optionally allows bandwidth configuration, followed by signal monitoring. 
```python
class Modem(NetworkDevice):
    def authenticate(self):
        for attempt in range(3):
            print("\nEnter your ISP credentials:")
            account_id = input("ISP Account ID: ").strip()
            password = input("ISP Password: ").strip()
            if account_id and password:
                print("\nAuthenticated with ISP successfully.")
                return True
            else:
                print("\nInvalid credentials. Please try again.")
        print("\nAuthentication failed after 3 attempts.")
        return False

    def configure(self):
        while True:
            response = input("\nWould you like to set a bandwidth limit? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
            if response == "yes":
                try:
                    bandwidth = int(input("Enter bandwidth limit (in Mbps): ").strip())
                    if bandwidth > 0:
                        print(f"\nBandwidth limit set to {bandwidth} Mbps.")
                        return
                    else:
                        print("\nBandwidth must be a positive number.")
                except ValueError:
                    print("\nInvalid input. Please enter a numeric value for bandwidth.")
            elif response == "no":
                print("\nSkipping bandwidth configuration.")
                return
            else:
                print("\nInvalid choice. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")

    def monitor_network(self):
        print("\nChecking signal strength... Signal is stable.")

    def operate(self):
        if self.is_status:
            if self.authenticate():
                self.configure()
                self.monitor_network()
                print(f"\nModem at {self.ip_address} is now handling internet traffic.")
        else:
            print("\nModem is offline. Connect it first.")
```
üîÅ The **Hub** functions as a basic data distributor, detecting and displaying all active connections. It can also enable optional network monitoring for tracking traffic activity across the network.
```python

class Hub(NetworkDevice):
    def monitor_network(self):
        while True:
            response = input("\nWould you like to enable network traffic monitoring? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
            if response == "yes":
                print("Network traffic monitoring enabled.")
                return
            elif response == "no":
                print("\nSkipping network monitoring.")
                return
            else:
                print("\nInvalid choice. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")

    def operate(self):
        if self.is_status:
            print("\nChecking connected devices...")
            connected_devices = [dev.ip_address for dev in devices if dev.is_status]
            if connected_devices:
                print(f"Devices connected to the hub: {', '.join(connected_devices)}")
                print("Broadcasting data to all connected devices.")
            else:
                print("\nNo devices connected to the hub.")
            self.monitor_network()
        else:
            print("\nHub is offline. Connect it first.")
```

## üß© Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles Demonstrated

### üîí Encapsulation
Each network device class hides sensitive attributes like status and credentials, and provides clean methods such as `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `operate()` for controlled access and interaction.

### üß± Abstraction
The abstract class `NetworkDevice` defines essential behaviors like `operate()` and `show_info()` without specifying their implementation. Each subclass provides its own version of these behaviors.

### üß¨ Inheritance
Classes `Router`, `Modem`, and `Hub` inherit shared properties and methods from `NetworkDevice`, promoting code reuse and establishing a consistent interface across devices.

### üîÄ Polymorphism
Each subclass redefines the `operate()` method to execute device-specific logic. This allows the program to handle various device types uniformly while still performing distinct actions.
